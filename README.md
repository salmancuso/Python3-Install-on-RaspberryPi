# Python3-Install-on-RaspberryPi

The in of this repository is to provide a guideline for installing Python 3 on a Raspberry Pi or any Debian/Ubuntu based Linux machine. 

There are three sections.  The first will install dependencies that python 3 will need. The second is the instantiation of Python 3. Finally, we will make Python 3 our default python on our machine.

Why will I make Python 3 my default on my system vs. Python 2?  For the majority of my coding life I've worked in Python 2, it is comfortable, easy to use and let's face it there has been an abundance of libraries.  That said in the year 2020 (which is less than three years from the time I am wrighting this) Python 2 will be discontinued and support (upgrades and patches) will cease.
